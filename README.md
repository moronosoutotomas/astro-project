## Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
